## DAY 1
Interesting Puzzle, I used awful regex to get everything directly

```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.0016875  seconds
Part 2 : 0.002  seconds
```
## DAY 2
Part 2 was a bit underwhelming, it never made use of each subsets drawn (the semicolon groups).
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.000484375 seconds
Part 2 : 0.000921875 seconds
```
## DAY 3
Could be improved but I'm happy with the solution I've found
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.00578125 seconds
Part 2 : 0.006578125 seconds
```
## DAY 4
Made fast and dirty.
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.000828125 seconds
Part 2 : 0.0009375 seconds
```
## DAY 5
I spent far too much time on the second part, which is nonetheless interesting
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.000625 seconds
Part 2 : 0.004265625 seconds
```
## DAY 6
I feel dumb because I bruteforced :).
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.000109375 seconds
Part 2 : 0.000171875 seconds
```
## DAY 7
Couldn't do it in the morning.
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 0.0025625 seconds
Part 2 : 0.002796875 seconds
```
## DAY 8
Tomorrow is another day
```
Timing for an execution, mean of 1000 itterations
Part 1 : 86400? seconds
Part 2 : 86400? seconds
```
